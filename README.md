#Week1

DisMath or Discrete Mathematics, is a subject where the only thing you have to deal with is logic.And from the comments of the higher batch or those who already took up Dismath, it is really a hard subject to pass. 

Sir Cabatuan, our professor in dismath, is an ECE professor who has traveled a lot of countries where he 

I've learned the following in our first day:

a.  Proposition- w/c is a declarative sentence; either True or False

b.  Examples on how to distinguish if the statement is a proposition or not

c.  Truth Values: T/1 (true proposition),  F/0 (false proposition) 

d.  Logical operators such as: 

  1. Conjunction (^) 
  
  -"p and q"
  
  -TRUE when both p and q are T
  
  -minimum of p and q
  
  2.Disjunction (∨) 

  -"p or q"
  
  -FALSE when both are false
  
  -maximum of p and q
  
  3.Exclusive Disjunction (⊕)
  
  -"p or q" (but not both)
  
  -TRUE if exactly one of p and q is True
  
  4.Implication (→) 
  
  - "if p, then q", etc.
  
  -TRUE when pa and q are True

  -TRUE when p is false
  
  5.Biconditional (↔) 
  
- "if and only if"
  
  -TRUE when both p and q are both True and False

  6. Negation (-) - "not p"
  
e. Truth table- it is a list of all posiible inputs/ combination of inputs w/ corresponding outputs

f. (2^n) - the formula to get the number of rows; n as the number of variables


#Week2

I've learned the following:

a. Contrapositive

  - "-q → -p"
  
  - same truth value with p→q
  
b. Inverse

  - "-p→-q"
  
c. Converse

  - "q→p"
  - 
d. Precedence of logical Operators

   (¬) - 1
   
   (^) - 2
   
   (v) - 3
   
   (→) - 4
   
   (↔) - 5
   
e. System Specifications

  - should be CONSISTENT( not conflicting requirement that could be used to contradict)

f. Propositional Equivalences

  1. Tautology (always True)

  2. Contradiction (always False)
  
  3. Contingency (neither True nor False)
  
g. Logical equivalences

  - compound proposition have same truth values in all possible cases
  
  - "p = q"
  
  - different laws:
  
  Identity Law

  Domination Law
  
  Idempotent Law
  
  Double Negation
  
  Commutative Law
  
  Associative Law
  
  Distributive Law
  
  De Morgan's Law
  
  Absorption Law
  
  Negation Law

h. Propositional Logic

  - deals w/ proposition as whole

i. Predicate Logic

  - has internal structure in terms of SUBJECT and PREDICATE

j. Quantifiers

  - indicates generality of subject/ predicate

  - kinds:

      Existential quantifier - is true if and only if P(x) is true for atleast 1 value of x in the domain

      Universal quantifier - asserts that a property is true for all values of a variable in a particular domain

  
  
  #Week3

On week 3 we were able to tackle the RULES OF INFERENCE:

Rules of Inference

-validity of conclusion, if and only if premises are all true
  
  Argument
    - a sequence of statements that end with a conclusion
    
  Validity of the Argument
    
    -means that the conclusion, or the final statement is dependent on the structure of the premise
    
  Argument Form
  
  -propositional logic is a sequence of compound propositions involving propositional variables
  
  Validity of Argument Form
  
  -means that whatever the substituted propositions are for the propositional variables in the premise, still the conclusion is true  if the premises are all true
    
  Fallacies
  
  -incorrect reasoning that leads to invalid arguments
  

METHODS OF PROOF

  Theorems
  
    - a statement that can be shown to be true; also referred to as facts or results
    
  Proof
  
    -a valid argument that establishes the truth of the theorem
    
1. Direct Proofs (in Conditional Statements)

  1.a Assume that P is true
  
  1.b Show that Q is also true based on statement 1
  
  * Odd Numbers {2k + 1 | k is an integer}
  
  * Even Numbers {2k | k is an integer}
  
    example: 0 is an even number

#Week4

2. Proof by Contraposition (Indirect proofs)

  *If p is complicated than q, use proof by contraposition

    2.a Assume -q is true
  
    2.b Show that -p is also true based on statement 1
    
3. Vacuos Proof (-p → (p→q))

    3.a show that p is false, because p→q must be true when p is false
  
4. Trivial Proof (q → (p→q))

    4.a show that q is true, it follows that p→q must also be true
  
5. Proof by Contradiction

    5.a Assume that the premise is not true 
  
    { ¬(premise) = T }  - negation of the whole premise
  
    5.b Show that statement 1 will end up in a contradiction 
  
*Rational Numbers 

    {a/b | a,b are integers, b not equal to 0, a & b doesn't have a common factore except +- 1}
    
    {in lowest terms}
    
Proofs of Equivalence ( Biconditionals)

    p ↔ q , p→q and q→p are both true 

    *q→p is a converse
    

#Week5 

There's a continuation of the discussion about the proof by equivalence with some examples to exercise us with. 

One example is: "Every positive integer is the sum of the squares of 2 integers." This is proven by counterexample  for it can't be expressed as the sum of the squares of 2 integers. 

Mathematical Induction is also discussed in which it is a proof technique used to prove results about wide range of objects. 

1. Basis: Show P(1) or P(0) to be true.

2. Inductive step

2.a. Assume P(k) is True. 

2.b. Show P(k+1) is True.
